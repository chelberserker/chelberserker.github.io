## The first paper from my PhD project

Paper titled "Balance of hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction of polymers and surfactants: Case of anionic surfactant and hydrophobically modified polymer" is out on the journal website.

In this work we have used Small-Angle X-ray Scattering combined with tensiometry to study the structure of PVP-SDS aggregates. Additionally, we looked at the precipitate formation at low pH, which was found to form a very dry lamellar phase.
This "dehydration" helps understand the precise mechanism of polymer surfactant interaction in this case. Tensiometry reveals a precise molar ratio between polymer and surfactant.

This paper is published in open access and can be found here: [Link to the full text](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2025.137572 "Journal of Colloid and Interface Science")

The first paper from my PhD project

Paper titled "Humidity-Induced Structural Transformation in Self-Organized Polymer–Surfactant Multilayer Nanofilms" is out on the journal website.

In this work we have used Neutron Reflectometry together with various X-ray surface measurements to reveal a structure on multiple length scales.
This helped to elucidate a mechanism of surfactant migration in dried polymer matrix and lateral phase separation driven by the incompatibility between surfactant tails and highly swollen polymer.
Incredible modeling of the off-specular neutron reflectivity was done by Phillip Gutfreund, scientist at FIGARO.

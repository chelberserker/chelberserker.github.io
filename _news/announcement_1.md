# PhD viva

I have defended my PhD thesis at the University of Bristol titled: 

**Connecting polymer-surfactant interaction in solution with the structure on the interface: Interplay between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces**

It was an immense pleasure to talk about my work with Dr. Richard Campbell (second on the left) from University of Manchester and Dr. Avinash Patil (on the right) from University of Bristol.
Many thanks to my supervisors: Prof. Wuge Briscoe (second on the right) and Dr. Oleg Konovalov (not in the picture).

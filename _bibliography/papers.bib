abstract = {We have investigated the humidity-responsive structure of polymer–surfactant multilayer nanofilms composed of a hydrophilic maleic acid polymer and an amphoteric amine oxide surfactant (C12-AO). Neutron reflectometry (NR) revealed the presence of a smooth thin film comprising several surfactant bilayers intercalated with the polymer. Upon exposure to increased humidity, the nanostructured film reorganized into a vertically stratified multilayer structure with polymer chains located in the vicinity of hydrated surfactant headgroups, with further humidity increase leading to the formation of surfactant-rich domains, indicating a high mobility of the surfactant molecules in the polymer matrix. Off-specular neutron reflectometry and grazing-incidence X-ray scattering revealed the presence of surfactant nanocrystals in the as-prepared film, which diffused to form surfactant-rich domains upon exposure to humidity, thus providing a reservoir of surfactants. These findings help elucidate a mechanism of structural transformation in dried polymer–surfactant films, thus suggesting an avenue for engineering an antimicrobial coating with longevity and a humidity-activated release of active molecules using two-dimensional confinement effects.},

abstract = {We investigated the structure of polymer-surfactant aggregates and their pH-dependent structural evolution using hydrophobically modified poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (h-PVP) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The structure of the complexes in the weak (pH ≃ 9) and strong (pH ≃ 2) interaction regimes was studied using small-angle X-ray scattering, with the data analysed on an absolute intensity scale, using molecular parameters as constraints. At pH 9, where self-assembly was driven by hydrophobic interactions, we have found that, at low surfactant concentrations, elongated aggregates were formed. At excess surfactant concentrations, the aggregates became more compact with a smaller aggregation number, resembling free micelles with the hydrophobic domains of the polymer incorporated into the surfactant core. In all cases, aggregates formed a continuous network, with polymer serving as a weak cross-linker between aggregates. Finally, we have compared the structure of these weakly interacting aggregates with the precipitates formed at low pH, where the electrostatic attraction dominates.}

The hard semicrystalline state facilitates piercing of the body whereupon the material softens to match the mechanics of surrounding soft tissue. To understand the transition between the two states, the crystallization process was studied with synchrotron X-ray scattering for a series of brush elastomers with poly(ε-caprolactone) side chains bearing from 7 to 13 repeat units. The so-called bottlebrush correlation peak was used to monitor configuration of bottlebrush backbones in the amorphous regions during the crystallization process. In the course of crystallization, the backbones are expelled into the interlamellar amorphous gaps, which is accompanied by their conformational changes and leads to partitioning to unconfined (melt) and confined (semicrystalline) (conformational) states. The crystallization process starts by consumption of the unconfined macromolecules by the growing crystals followed by reconfiguration of macromolecules within the already grown spherulites.},

Non-covalent functionalization by peptides and other organic molecules allows changing the properties of graphitic surfaces in a controlled manner and represents a big potential for fundamental research and applications. Recently described oligopeptide-hydrocarbon derivative N,N'-(decane-1,10-diyl)bis(tetraglycineamide) (GM) is highly prospective for the development of graphitic interfaces in biosensor application as well as in structural biology for improving the quality of high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) visualization of individual biomacromolecules. However, molecular organization of GM on graphitic surfaces is still unknown. In this work, the molecular model of GM at the water/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) interface has been developed basing on the high-resolution AFM and full-atom molecular modeling data. This model explains two periodicities observed in AFM images by GM self-assembly on a HOPG surface with formation of the stacks with the lateral shifts. The obtained results reveal the particular patterns and dynamics of GM molecules adsorbed on graphite and unravel the puzzle of peptide self-assembly on graphitic surfaces.},

	abstract = {The melting-induced change in the density of physical network junctions, which are formed by chain entanglements and network junctions due to anchoring of chain segments to crystals, is studied by 1H NMR T2 relaxometry for solution- and melt-crystallized ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), sc-UH, and mc-UH, respectively. The NMR results are complemented by real-time synchrotron wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS) analyses to extract the sizes of the crystalline lamellae and intercrystalline domains. Below the melting temperature, the network of physical junctions is denser in the amorphous phase of mc-UH than the one in sc-UH owing to a lower entanglement density and a smaller number of physical junctions from polymer crystals in sc-UH. However, the difference in the total density of physical junctions between mc-UH and sc-UH films decreases with decreasing crystallinity during melting. At the end of the melting trajectory, at vanishing crystallinity, the volume-average entanglement density, as characterized by the NMR method, is approximately the same in sc- and mc-UH. This indicates that the entanglement density in sc-UH films increases during melting owing to the fast buildup of local chain entanglements. These entanglements are formed by segments of the same chain, neighboring chains, or both due to a displacement of chain fragments upon lamellar thickening and due to the so-called “chain explosion” that occurs locally in the amorphous domains. The increase in the entanglement density in sc-UH is additionally confirmed by the solid-state drawability of sc-UH films that were annealed in the melting region but below the end of melting. The maximum draw ratio decreases and the drawing stress increases with the increasing annealing temperature.},

	abstract = {The ability of living species to transition between rigid and flexible shapes represents one of their survival mechanisms, which has been adopted by various human technologies. Such transition is especially desired in medical devices as rigidity facilitates the implantation process, while flexibility and softness favor biocompatibility with surrounding tissue. Traditional thermoplastics cannot match soft tissue mechanics, while gels leach into the body and alter their properties over time. Here, a single-component system with an unprecedented drop of Young's modulus by up to six orders of magnitude from the GPa to kPa level at a controlled temperature within 28–43 °C is demonstrated. This approach is based on brush-like polymer networks with crystallizable side chains, e.g., poly(valerolactone), affording independent control of melting temperature and Young's modulus by concurrently altering side chain length and crosslink density. Softening down to the tissue level at the physiological temperature allows the design of tissue-adaptive implants that can be inserted as rigid devices followed by matching the surrounding tissue mechanics at body temperature. This transition also enables thermally triggered release of embedded drugs for anti-inflammatory treatment.},

Homopolymers as well as statistical and block copolymers with n-propyl and/or allyl trimethylene-1,1-dicarboxylate blocks have been obtained from PolyC3 precursors containing diallyl trimethylene-1,1-dicarboxylate units, by reacting C6F13–C2H4–SH and C8F17–C2H4–SH thiols with the allyl groups using a thiol–ene post-polymerization modification reaction. Solid-state properties have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry for all of the (co)polymers and by small-angle X-ray scattering/wide-angle X-ray scattering for the C8F17 homopolymer at several temperatures. The structure of the homopolymer consistently shows a coexistence of two smectic phases at room temperature, which can be identified as SmB and SmC. This coexistence is assumed to arise from the fact that the distances between carboxylic oxygens bonded to the same carbon are very close to the ones between the neighboring carboxylic oxygens alongside the backbone, resulting in two possible ways of packing the pendent fluoroalkyl chains arranged in a hexatic order.},
